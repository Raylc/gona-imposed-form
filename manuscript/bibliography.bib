	abstract = {The Evolution of Paleolithic Technologies provides a novel perspective on long-term trajectories of evolutionary change in Paleolithic tools and tool-makers. 
Members of the human lineage have been producing stone tools for more than 3 million years. These artefacts provide key evidence for important evolutionary developments in hominin behaviour and cognition. Avoiding conventional approaches based on progressive stages of development, this book instead examines global trends in six separate dimensions of technological behaviour between 2.6 million and 10,000 years ago. Combining these independent trends results in both a broader and a more finely punctuated perspective on key intervals of change in hominin behaviour. To draw this picture together, the concluding section explores behavioural, cognitive, and demographic implications of developments in material culture and technological procedures at seven key intervals during the Pleistocene. 


Researchers interested in Paleolithic archaeology will find this book invaluable. It will also be of interest to archaeologists researching stone tool technology and to students of human evolution and behavioural change in prehistory.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of handaxe shape is one of the most prominent questions in Acheulean archaeological studies. Nowhere is this question as sharply defined as in Britain, where there are a number of distinct handaxe shape types. Recently reduction intensity has come to the fore as an explanation for the creation of different biface shapes, however many Acheulean researchers do not see compelling evidence for differential reduction at their sites. In this study we report an experiment in which knappers, naïve as to the goal of the experiment, reduced handaxes according to different protocols. Changes in shape and flake scar density were recorded as reduction progressed. These trajectories of shape change are compared to those seen at five British Acheulean sites: Boxgrove, High Lodge, Hitchin, Swanscombe, and Broom. Our results show that although there is evidence for differential reduction intensity at these sites, this did not have a strong influence on shape. Reduction was never exhaustive, suggesting that the life history of these tools was short. Temporally and spatially variable traditions are a better fit for the observed patterns of shape variation.},

	abstract = {Quantifying biface reduction is an important goal in Palaeolithic archaeology for determining the length of reduction sequences, and to contextualise interpretations of biface morphology. In particular there is contention as to whether or not Acheulean handaxes were resharpened. Here we test the flake scar density index (SDI), calculated using 3D laser scans of bifaces, as a measure of handaxe reduction. We experimentally reduced an assemblage of 57 handaxes tracking changes in their SDI and mass lost at each stage of reduction. We tested the effects of blank type, coarseness of the stone, and different protocols for reduction. Our results show that the SDI is indeed an effective measure of mass lost, although it is influenced by the blank type of the handaxe. We applied the SDI to two archaeological assemblages of Acheulean bifaces from East Africa: Kariandusi and Isenya; and two archaeological assemblages from India: Patpara and Bhimbetka. Exotic materials were more reduced at Kariandusi and Isenya. A relationship between SDI and volume, such that smaller handaxes have higher scar densities, and are thus likely small because they have been reduced more, suggests resharpening. Conversely, the lack of such a relationship may be taken as evidence that bifaces were not resharpened. Our results show that exotic handaxes from Kariandusi, local handaxes from Isenya, and bifaces in general from Patpara were resharpened. On the other hand neither local handaxes from Kariandusi, cleavers from Isenya, nor cleavers from Bhimbetka, were resharpened. The unretouched bit formed by the termination of the original flake blank on the Isenya and Bhimbetka cleavers provides independent evidence for the lack of resharpening.},
